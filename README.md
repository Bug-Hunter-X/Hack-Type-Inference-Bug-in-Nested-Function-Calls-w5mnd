This repository demonstrates a subtle type inference bug in Hack that may occur when dealing with complex function calls involving nested functions. The bug involves incorrect type checking that may not be immediately obvious. The solution involves explicitly specifying types in function signatures and/or intermediate variables to ensure the type checker correctly infers the intended types.
